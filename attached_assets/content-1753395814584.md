This page provides a comprehensive overview of the Mapbox Standard style's configuration options. The Mapbox Standard style is a modern, continuously improving style designed to reduce configuration complexity while delivering high-quality map visualizations.

## Configuration Properties [​](https://docs.mapbox.com/map-styles/standard/api/\#configuration-properties "Direct link to Configuration Properties")

Mapbox Standard provides the following configuration properties which you can apply when first importing the style, or at runtime after the style is already loaded. Implementation code is platform specific, but the configuration options are the same across all platforms.

## Featuresets [​](https://docs.mapbox.com/map-styles/standard/api/\#featuresets "Direct link to Featuresets")

Mapbox Standard includes several predefined `featuresets` that can be used to quickly configure the style for specific use cases. Featuresets are a collection of configuration properties that can be applied to the style all at once. The following featuresets are available:

You can use Interactions to retrieve basemap attributes and interact with individual features in POI Label, Place Label and building layers in the basemap.

Featuresets describe a collection of layers that can be interacted with in the Standard style, by setting `feature-states` to change their appearance when interacted with, or to query feature attributes. The following interactions have been added:

* * *

### Points of Interest [​](https://docs.mapbox.com/map-styles/standard/api/\#points-of-interest "Direct link to Points of Interest")

The `poi` featureset contains all the point of interest layers in the Mapbox Standard style. This featureset is useful for applications that want to display additional information about points of interest on the map, or to highlight points of interest when a user interacts with them.

#### Feature State [​](https://docs.mapbox.com/map-styles/standard/api/\#feature-state "Direct link to Feature State")

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hide` | `Boolean` | when `true` hides the icon and text. Use this state when displaying a custom annotation in place of the hidden symbol. |

#### Feature Properties [​](https://docs.mapbox.com/map-styles/standard/api/\#feature-properties "Direct link to Feature Properties")

Available for all features in the `poi` featureset:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Name of the point of interest. |
| `class` | A broad point of interest category, for example 'food\_and\_drink'. |
| `maki` | An icon identifier, designed to assign icons using the Maki icon project or other icons that follow the same naming scheme. |
| `group` | A high-level point of interest category like airport, transit, etc. |

Available for features with `group = transit-label`:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `transit_mode` | Mode of transport served by a stop/station. |
| `transit_stop_type` | A type of transit stop. |
| `transit_network` | A rail station network identifier that is part of specific local or regional transit systems. |

Available for features with `group = airport-label`:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `airport_ref` | A short identifier code of the airport. |

### Place Labels [​](https://docs.mapbox.com/map-styles/standard/api/\#place-labels "Direct link to Place Labels")

The `place-labels` featureset contains all the place label layers in the Mapbox Standard style. This featureset is useful for applications that want to display additional information about places on the map, or to highlight places when a user interacts with them.

#### Feature State [​](https://docs.mapbox.com/map-styles/standard/api/\#feature-state-1 "Direct link to Feature State")

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hide` | `Boolean` | When `true`, hides the label. Use this state when displaying a custom annotation in place of the hidden symbol. |
| `highlight` | `Boolean` | When `true`, the feature is highlighted. Use this state to create a temporary effect (e.g., hover). |
| `select` | `Boolean` | When `true`, the feature is selected. Use this state to create an effect that persists until another state is selected. **Note:** The `select` state has a higher priority than `highlight`. |

#### Feature Properties [​](https://docs.mapbox.com/map-styles/standard/api/\#feature-properties-1 "Direct link to Feature Properties")

Each feature in the `place-labels` featureset has the following properties:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Name of the place label |
| `class` | Provides a broad distinction between place types. |

You can see `select` & `highlight` in action in this [demo page](https://labs.mapbox.com/map-design-demos/ime/index.html).

### Landmark Icons [​](https://docs.mapbox.com/map-styles/standard/api/\#landmark-icons "Direct link to Landmark Icons")

The `landmark-icons` featureset contains all the icons and labels that highlight our 3D landmark buildings.

#### Feature Properties [​](https://docs.mapbox.com/map-styles/standard/api/\#feature-properties-2 "Direct link to Feature Properties")

Each feature in the `landmark-icons` featureset has the following properties:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Name of the landmark in local language. |
| `name_en` | Name of the landmark in English. |
| `short_name` | Short name of the landmark in local language. |

## Slots [​](https://docs.mapbox.com/map-styles/standard/api/\#slots "Direct link to Slots")

Mapbox Standard includes three [slot layers](https://docs.mapbox.com/style-spec/reference/layers/#slot) to help you control where custom layers will appear relative to other layers in the style. The following slots are available:

| Slot | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `bottom` | Above polygons (land, landuse, water, etc.) |
| `middle` | Above lines (roads, etc.) and behind 3D buildings |
| `top` | Above POI labels and behind Place and Transit labels |
| not specified | Above all existing layers in the style when not using the globe projection. Below labels when using the globe projection. Learn more about projections in the [Mapbox Style Spec reference](https://docs.mapbox.com/style-spec/reference/projection/). |
