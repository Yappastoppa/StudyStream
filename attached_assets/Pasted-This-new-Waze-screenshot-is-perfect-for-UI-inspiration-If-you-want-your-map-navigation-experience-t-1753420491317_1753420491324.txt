This new Waze screenshot is perfect for UI inspiration! If you want your map/navigation experience to look just like this, here’s an updated prompt you can give to your agent, dev, or ChatGPT:

Prompt: Redesign Navigation UI to Match Waze Style

⸻

Goal:
Redesign our navigation/map view so it looks and works like the attached Waze screenshot. We want a visually clean, driver-focused, 3D map experience with floating UI overlays and colorful route lines.

⸻

Design Requirements (refer to screenshot):
	1.	Full-Screen Map:
	•	The map covers the entire screen, with minimal padding.
	2.	3D Route & Centered User Arrow:
	•	Route line is bold and always centered, with turns and next streets clearly labeled (see “Steenland”/“Chestnut St.”).
	•	User location shown as a large arrow, centered in the lower half.
	3.	Floating Turn Instructions:
	•	Show the next turn as a compact floating panel at the top:
	•	Turn icon, distance (e.g., “0.5 Miles”), and street name in bold.
	•	No large black overlays or fixed panels.
	4.	Time/Distance Bar:
	•	At the bottom, show ETA, remaining minutes, and distance in a slim floating bar.
	5.	Alerts & Map Markers:
	•	Display crowd-sourced alerts (police, accidents, hazards) as small, colorful icons directly on the map, positioned above the route line.
	6.	Quick-Access Buttons:
	•	Add a floating expandable menu for reporting:
	•	Police, Accident, Gas, Chat, Place, Camera (as shown in right-most screenshot).
	•	The menu can pop up from a single main button in the corner—do not stack all buttons vertically!
	7.	Style:
	•	Bright, clear, and touch-friendly.
	•	Use semi-transparent overlays and drop shadows for UI elements.
	•	Prioritize bold colors for routes and alerts, with high contrast for all overlays.
	8.	Map Behavior:
	•	The map must always auto-center on the user and rotate to follow the driving direction (“compass mode”).
	•	The view should pan/tilt to always keep the next turn visible.
	•	When reporting or searching, expand the quick-access menu, but always keep most of the map visible.

Task for Agent/Dev:

**“Redesign our navigation/map screen to match the Waze layout and experience in the attached image.
	•	Make the map full-screen with a bold route line.
	•	Center the user’s arrow and float a minimal turn direction panel at the top.
	•	Put alerts and markers directly on the map, just above the route.
	•	Add a floating expandable quick-access report button.
	•	Always keep the map auto-centered on the user and rotate the map with their heading.
	•	Use color and touch-friendly UI.
	•	Reference the screenshot for layout, spacing, and design style.”**
