Absolutely—here’s a full, copy-paste prompt for your agent. This will guide it to add user-facing toast notifications for location tracking errors and place search failures throughout your navigation codebase. It assumes you have react-hot-toast installed and <Toaster /> mounted in your main app component.

Full Agent Patch Prompt for Error Toasts

⸻

Patch summary:
Add user-facing toast notifications for both location tracking errors and place search errors using react-hot-toast. These toasts should show a clear error message to the user when GPS/location fails or place search fails.

⸻

Implementation details:
	1.	Ensure import of react-hot-toast:
At the top of any file where you show toasts (usually use-navigation.ts or related hooks/components):

import toast from 'react-hot-toast';


	2.	Patch location tracking error handling:
In the function where you call navigator.geolocation.watchPosition, update the error callback like this:

watchPositionId.current = navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(
  // success callback,
  (error) => {
    console.error('Location tracking error:', error);
    toast.error(
      error.message === "User denied Geolocation"
        ? "Location permission denied. Enable GPS for navigation."
        : "Could not get your location. Please try again."
    );
  },
  {
    enableHighAccuracy: true,
    timeout: 5000,
    maximumAge: 1000
  }
);


	3.	Patch place search error handling:
In your place search function (for example, searchPlaces in use-navigation.ts or similar), update the error handling in the catch block like this:

catch (error) {
  console.error('Place search failed:', error);
  toast.error("Couldn't find that place. Check your connection or try a different search.");
  return [];
}


	4.	(If not done already) Mount the toaster once in your app root:
In your main app component (e.g., App.tsx or main.tsx):

import { Toaster } from 'react-hot-toast';

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <YourRoutesOrAppContent />
      <Toaster position="top-right" />
    </>
  );
}


	5.	Do not change any UI/UX styling or workflow—just show toasts on errors.
The toasts should dismiss automatically (default behavior) unless otherwise specified.

⸻

In summary, add the above toast logic to your navigation/location/place search error handling code paths. Make sure all user-facing navigation/location errors display an actionable toast to the user instead of failing silently.

⸻

EXTRA:
If the agent finds any other user-facing navigation/network/geolocation/voice synthesis errors not covered above, apply the same toast notification pattern there as well.
