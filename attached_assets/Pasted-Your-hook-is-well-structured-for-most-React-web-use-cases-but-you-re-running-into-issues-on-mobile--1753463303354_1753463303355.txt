Your hook is well-structured for most React web use cases, but you’re running into issues on mobile browsers (especially inside Replit Preview) where:
	•	The location prompt doesn’t appear
	•	The map keeps recentering/jittering
	•	The route polyline isn’t showing

Here’s an improved prompt for your agent, specifically referencing your custom hook and real device use:

Prompt for Agent:

I’m using a custom React hook (useGeolocation, see below) to handle user location in my navigation app. I need help addressing these issues that only show up when testing on real phones (not just in Replit Preview):
	1.	Location Permission Prompt:
	•	When running in Replit Preview, the browser never asks for location permission and geolocation fails.
	•	If I open the site in Safari/Chrome, it skips the prompt and just instantly centers on my location.
	•	I want it to ALWAYS ask the user to allow/deny location access, and show a clear error or message if denied or

Great question! Your custom useGeolocation hook is solid, but the issues you’re facing are a combo of browser restrictions, Replit Preview quirks, and possibly too-aggressive recentering/updating logic in your map code (not shown, but the problem sounds familiar).

Let’s break down each issue and solution:

⸻

1. Location Permission Prompt Not Appearing

Why?
	•	Replit Preview and some in-app browsers sandbox or block geolocation APIs.
	•	Some browsers will only prompt for geolocation if your site is served over HTTPS and in a user gesture (like a button click), NOT automatically on load.
	•	If location permission was previously denied, the prompt will NOT reappear until the user manually changes their browser settings.

How to Fix:
	•	Do not auto-trigger geolocation on load; instead, show a “Share Location” button and call getCurrentPosition only on user tap. Browsers require a “user gesture” to show the prompt!
	•	Check permission status with navigator.permissions.query (as you’re doing), but also handle prompt state and visually instruct the user to update settings if denied.
	•	Show a fallback screen with step-by-step instructions if permission is denied, rather than endlessly retrying.

Example (pseudo-code):

// On initial load, show "Share Location" button
<Button onClick={getCurrentPosition}>Share My Location</Button>

2. Glitchy Map Re-centering (Map Keeps Jumping or Refreshing)

Why?
	•	Every GPS update triggers a map center/zoom, which looks glitchy if frequent, or if minor changes (GPS jitter) are constantly “recentering.”
	•	Multiple components may be triggering map center independently.

How to Fix:
	•	Only recenter the map when:
a) User starts navigation
b) User taps a “Center” button
c) The position jumps by a significant threshold (e.g., >100m)
	•	During navigation, let the map “follow” the user, but throttle updates (e.g., once per second or only on significant changes).
	•	Debounce/throttle the actual recentering code.
	•	Ignore minor GPS drift when the user is stopped (speed < 2km/h).

Example:

// Pseudocode for throttling map center:
const [lastCenter, setLastCenter] = useState<Date>(null);

useEffect(() => {
  if (shouldRecenter && (!lastCenter || Date.now() - lastCenter > 1000)) {
    map.setCenter([state.lng, state.lat]);
    setLastCenter(Date.now());
  }
}, [state.lat, state.lng, shouldRe
