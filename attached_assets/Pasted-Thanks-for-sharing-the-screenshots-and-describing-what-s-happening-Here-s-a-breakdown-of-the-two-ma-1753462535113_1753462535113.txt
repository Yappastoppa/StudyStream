Thanks for sharing the screenshots and describing what’s happening. Here’s a breakdown of the two main issues you’re seeing, plus some suggestions and prompts to give your agent/dev to fix them:

⸻

1. Glitchy/Refreshing Zoom Effect
	•	What’s Happening: The map keeps “refreshing” or “jumping” in and out every couple seconds while in driver view, which feels janky instead of smooth like Waze.
	•	Likely Cause: This usually happens when the zoom or camera centering is being set on every GPS update, or there’s a repeated re-render every time state changes, rather than animating only when needed.
	•	What to Tell Your Dev/Agent:

The driver view is zooming in as expected, but it keeps refreshing or glitching every couple of seconds (the map zoom resets or jumps). Can you make sure that the map zoom and camera follow only update *smoothly* as my location changes, instead of force-resetting the zoom or re-centering each update? The camera should animate to follow my location like Waze, and not trigger a hard refresh every time. Also, only update the zoom level if the user is in driver view and the route has started, not on every GPS change.

2. Route Polyline Not Showing
	•	What’s Happening: When navigation starts, the ETA and turn instructions display correctly, but the route line (the colored path) on the map is missing, so you can’t see where you’re supposed to drive.
	•	Likely Cause: This usually happens when either:
	•	The route polyline rendering code isn’t being triggered after start, or
	•	The coordinates/state used for the polyline are not updating/being passed properly to the map component during navigation.
	•	What to Tell Your Dev/Agent:

When I start navigation, the map zooms and I see the instructions, but the route polyline isn’t being displayed on the map anymore (the colored driving path). Can you check that the route polyline is rendered whenever navigation is active, and make sure it stays visible/follows the current route until I reach my destination? It should update smoothly as my position changes.

3. (Bonus) For Asking Location Permission on Phones
	•	Extra Step: To make sure the app is always asking for the user’s location right away on mobile, and doesn’t get stuck waiting:
	•	What to Tell Your Dev/Agent:

Make sure that on page load or when the user tries to start navigation, we *immediately* request geolocation permissions if not already granted. Show a prompt or modal that explains: “We need your location to provide real-time navigation. Please allow location access in your browser or app settings.” If the user denies, show a clear error and instructions on how to enable it.

In summary, here’s your prompt to send:

⸻

The new navigation UI is almost working! Here’s what needs fixing:
	1.	Smooth Zoom: The zoom in driver view is glitchy—it keeps refreshing every couple seconds. Please make the map smoothly follow my location, only updating zoom/center when necessary (like Waze), not on every GPS state change.
	2.	Route Polyline: The route path (polyline) is missing when navigation starts. Make sure the colored route line is always shown and updates as I move, until I reach my destination.
	3.	Location Permission: On mobile, make sure we ask for location permission as soon as possible, with a clear prompt. If denied, explain to the user how to enable it.

Let me know when these are fixed so I can test again.

Let me know if you want to word this more casually, or want a full technical explanation for the dev!
