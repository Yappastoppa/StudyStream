Great feedback! The right-side button stack is wasting the left side, and the speedometer is way oversized compared to the map. You want a balanced, modern racing interface that actually uses the full screen and feels more like a real HUD.

Here’s the prompt to give your agent/dev/AI to fix all of this:

Prompt: Redesign Map Layout for Racing HUD – Use Both Sides, Balance UI

GOAL:
Create a visually balanced map interface for “GhostRacer”:
	•	Map is the focus: Fills the whole screen, clean and immersive.
	•	Speedometer is smaller, semi-transparent, and in a real HUD spot (bottom left or bottom center, not covering too much map).
	•	Map controls (buttons) are split on both sides for balance:
	•	Put most-used actions (e.g. alerts, camera, route, etc) on the left vertical edge.
	•	Keep view/setting toggles (e.g. simulation, filter) on the right vertical edge.
	•	Distribute vertically with flex/space-between, but leave at least 16px gap from the top/bottom so no button touches screen edges.
	•	Controls float over the map with glassmorphic, semi-transparent backgrounds (not solid blocks).

VISUAL EXAMPLE:

-----------------------------------------
|  ⬆️         MAP         ⚙️    🌓      |
|  🚨                       🏁         |
|  📸                       🔔         |
|  📍       [ MAP ]        👤         |
|  🚗    [speed: 20mph]    ☁️         |
-----------------------------------------

	•	Left: action icons (alert, camera, etc.)
	•	Right: settings, profile, weather, etc.
	•	Speed is bottom left, not huge.

STYLE:
	•	Modern, motorsport/racing look.
	•	Controls should be visible but not overwhelming.
	•	Everything is above the map with pointer-events and shadow.
	•	Map is always 100% width/height behind all controls.

MOBILE + DESKTOP:
	•	Works for all sizes; rearrange for mobile (speedometer bottom center, buttons smaller).

⸻

INSTRUCTIONS for DEV/AGENT
	•	Refactor the container:
	•	Use absolute inset-0 for the map background.
	•	Add two side divs (absolute left-0 h-full flex flex-col justify-between and same for right), each with half the action buttons.
	•	Place the speedometer as absolute bottom-6 left-6 and keep it under 120px width/height, with backdrop-blur and opacity.
	•	Remove excess padding and wrappers.
	•	If needed, show a quick Figma wireframe or visual mockup.

⸻

What NOT to do:
	•	Do not stack all buttons in a single column.
	•	Do not use the full width for the speed box.

⸻

“Refactor the HUD so map fills everything, split controls left/right, smaller speedometer on bottom left, and everything overlays the map. Style for racing, glassmorphic/semi-transparent backgrounds, and never block the map.”

Give this directly to your agent/dev/AI and they’ll get the idea!
