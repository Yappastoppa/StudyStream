Alright—pivoting GhostRacer into a web-hosted Progressive Web App (PWA) is totally doable. Below is a high-level architecture and MVP roadmap so you can get straight to coding and hosting:

⸻

1. Tech Stack & Hosting

Layer	Technology	Why
Frontend	React (Next.js) or Vue.js	Component-based, PWA support, server-side rendering
Map & Geolocation	Mapbox GL JS or Leaflet + MapLibre	Fast vector maps, tile caching, WebGL overlays
Geometry	Turf.js	On-device straight/curvature calculations in JS
Real-Time	Socket.IO (Node.js) or Firebase Realtime / Firestore + Functions	Bi-directional updates for location & alerts
Auth & Invites	JWT + invite codes in your DB (PostgreSQL or Firestore)	Simple emailless login via one-time codes
Backend	Node.js + Express (or Firebase Functions)	Lightweight API for invites, events, reports
Database	PostgreSQL + PostGIS (or Firestore)	Geospatial queries, TTL for alerts
Hosting	Vercel/Netlify (frontend) + Heroku/AWS/Firebase (backend)	CI/CD, SSL, global edge CDN

2. Core Web Features
	1.	Anonymous Invite-Only Login
	•	User enters a one-time invite code → backend returns a short-lived JWT.
	•	Store JWT in localStorage; no email required.
	2.	Map Dashboard
	•	Ask for browser geolocation (HTTPS required).
	•	Render user’s position, other “live” users (fuzzed), and alert markers on Mapbox/Leaflet.
	•	“Ghost Mode” toggle: hides your icon but still sends proximity alerts to others.
	3.	Crowdsourced Alerts
	•	“Report Police/Camera” buttons on the map.
	•	Send your fuzzed location + type via socket to the server.
	•	Server broadcasts alerts to all clients within their chosen radius; frontend shows pop-up and a brief toast.
	4.	Radius & Presence Settings
	•	Simple sidebar or modal where users pick “share radius” (e.g. 500 m, 1 km).
	•	“Go Live” vs. “Ghost” vs. “Offline” buttons.
	5.	Synchronized Start Sequence
	•	Two users “link” by entering each other’s IDs or via a shared event room.
	•	Server writes startTime = now + 5s (using server clock).
	•	Clients receive it, do a local countdown, and trigger a JS callback at exactly that timestamp.
	6.	Event Requests & Back-and-Forth
	•	In-map “Challenge” button → opens a small form (event type, time, location).
	•	Sends via socket to the target user.
	•	Target sees a modal “Accept / Suggest Alternative”; updates go into the same room until status = accepted.
	7.	Basic Road Shape Analysis (Optional MVP)
	•	On demand, fetch OSM ways in the current viewport (via Overpass JSON).
	•	Use Turf.js to compute longest-straight or curviest segments.
	•	Overlay those as vector polylines on the map.

3. MVP Roadmap

Phase 1: Authentication & Real-Time Map
	•	Invite-code login + JWT.
	•	Browser geolocation → show “you” on map.
	•	Socket.IO channel for user_status updates → broadcast moving pins.
	•	“Go Live” / “Go Ghost” toggles.

Phase 2: Crowdsourced Alerts
	•	UI buttons for “Report Police” / “Report Camera.”
	•	Backend stores in-memory or in DB with TTL (5 min).
	•	Broadcast to nearby clients → frontend toast and marker.

Phase 3: Event Flow & Start Sync
	•	Simple “Link to Driver” form → join a private Socket.IO room.
	•	Event-request UI + back-and-forth via the room.
	•	Start-time handshake: server emits startTime → clients countdown.

Phase 4: Road Analysis & PWA Enhancements
	•	Turf.js + Overpass integration for “find straights/curves.”
	•	Add service worker for map tile & Overpass response caching.
	•	Installable PWA (add to home screen), offline-capable map cache.

Phase 5: Polishing & Hosting
	•	Responsive CSS for desktop/mobile.
	•	Deploy frontend to Vercel/Netlify, backend to Heroku/AWS/Firebase.
	•	Set up real-time monitoring (Sentry/LogRocket) and basic analytics.

4. Next Steps
	1.	Repo Kick-off
	•	Scaffold a Next.js (or Vue/Nuxt) project.
	•	Add Socket.IO or Firebase SDK.
	•	Configure Mapbox GL JS.
	2.	Database Schema
	•	users(inviteCode, uid, shareRadius, visibility, lastLat, lastLon)
	•	alerts(id, type, fuzzedLat, fuzzedLon, timestamp)
	•	events(id, hostUid, guestUid, status, details…)
	3.	API Endpoints (if not using Firebase)
	•	POST /api/login (inviteCode → JWT)
	•	GET /api/overpass?bbox=… (optional if you self-proxy Overpass)
	•	Socket handlers: joinRoom, statusUpdate, createAlert, createEvent, startSync.
	4.	UI Wireframes
	•	Map view with lean sidebar: live/ghost toggle, radius selector, report buttons.
	•	Modal for challenge requests.
	•	Countdown overlay for starts.

Once you have the skeleton up, you can iterate rapidly: start with location sharing + alert reporting, then layer in events, sync, and road-analysis. Hosting on Vercel + Heroku (or Firebase Hosting + Functions) gets you global SSL, instant deploys, and minimal ops. Whenever you’re ready, I can help you set up the initial code scaffolding.
