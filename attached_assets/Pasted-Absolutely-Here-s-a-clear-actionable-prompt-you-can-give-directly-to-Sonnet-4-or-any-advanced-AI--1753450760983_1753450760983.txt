Absolutely! Here’s a clear, actionable prompt you can give directly to Sonnet 4 (or any advanced AI agent) to help you replicate the Waze/Google Maps navigation experience using open-source navigation code and modern UI:

Prompt for Sonnet 4:

Goal:
I want you to help me build a modern driving/navigation app UI—styled like Waze or Google Maps—using open-source tools (Mapbox GL JS, MapLibre, or React Native Mapbox Navigation). The core features should include:
	•	Full-screen dark map background
	•	Clear, colored navigation route (turn-by-turn directions)
	•	Current position dot (centered, auto-panning as I move)
	•	Upcoming turns, street names, and time/distance remaining
	•	Overlays for police, speed traps, hazards, etc.
	•	Floating, intuitive UI controls (center, report hazard, etc.) spaced around the map, not overlapping

Your task:
	•	Find and adapt a real, open-source navigation UI (from GitHub if possible—see projects like “react-native-mapbox-navigation” or “maplibre-gl-directions”).
	•	Show me how to:
	•	Implement the navigation view with step-by-step directions (just like Waze/Google Maps)
	•	Make the map pan/follow my real-time GPS location and rotate with heading
	•	Add well-spaced, floating UI controls
	•	Style the entire interface for maximum clarity (large labels, bold turns, colored routes, traffic, etc.)
	•	Bonus: Suggest how to allow users to report or see hazards/speed traps as map overlays.

Be specific! Show actual code snippets, best practices, and what libraries/plugins to use (React, React Native, or web JS okay). If possible, give an outline or links to any existing projects that best match this Waze-style navigation experience.

How to use this:
	•	Copy-paste the above directly into Sonnet 4’s prompt box.
	•	Feel free to add details about your stack (React Native, Vite+React, or pure JS) or desired region/style.
	•	You can also link or describe one of the GitHub repos above if you want it to build off a specific project!

Let me know if you want it tailored for a specific platform (iOS/Android/web) or with even more details.
