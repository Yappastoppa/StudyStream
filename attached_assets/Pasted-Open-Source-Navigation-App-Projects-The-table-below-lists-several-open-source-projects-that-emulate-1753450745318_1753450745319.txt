Open-Source Navigation App Projects

The table below lists several open-source projects that emulate Waze/Google Maps-style navigation apps, featuring full-screen maps (often dark mode), turn-by-turn directions, real-time GPS tracking, and modern frameworks as requested:

Repository & Link	Tech Stack	Core Features	Last Update
React Native Mapbox Navigation (homeeondemand) ￼	React Native (TypeScript) + Mapbox	Drop-in turn-by-turn navigation UI for iOS/Android with voice guidance, day/night map styles, and real-time traffic rerouting ￼. Supports CarPlay, multiple transport modes (drive, cycle, walk), and multi-language prompts ￼.	Active – last commit Feb 2023 (v2.1.1 SDK update) ￼
Ferrostar Navigation SDK (Stadia Maps) ￼	Rust core; MapLibre GL (Web & Native), React Native bindings	Cross-platform navigation SDK (iOS, Android, Web) with full turn-by-turn routing built on MapLibre GL ￼. Highly customizable; supports multiple map and routing providers, traffic data, and integrates with React Native. Open-source (BSD) with active development by Stadia Maps.	Very active – v0.39.0 released Jul 2025 ￼
MapLibre GL Directions ￼	JavaScript/TypeScript (MapLibre GL JS, Svelte)	Web routing plugin for MapLibre GL that provides Google Maps–style route planning. Displays routes and step-by-step directions on a full-screen map ￼, with interactive waypoint adding/removal and draggable routes (touch-friendly) ￼. Supports multiple providers (OSRM, Mapbox Directions API) and traffic congestion indicators ￼.	Active – v0.8.0 released Feb 2025 ￼
Mapbox Guidance Simulator ￼	JavaScript (Mapbox GL JS)	Simulated navigation playback on a web map for demo/testing. Uses Mapbox GL JS and Directions API to imitate in-car navigation – can play through a route at high speed, auto-rotate/zoom the map on maneuvers, and seek to route timestamps ￼. Useful for testing turn-by-turn UI without driving.	Inactive (Mapbox demo tool from 2016 ￼; compatible with Mapbox GL JS v1)
Google-Map-Clone ￼ (Mapbox GL JS)	HTML, JavaScript (Mapbox GL JS)	Google Maps–style web app using Mapbox GL JS. Full-screen interactive map with browser geolocation, route finding between points, and display of the shortest path and travel time for driving, cycling, walking, etc. ￼. Demonstrates Mapbox GL JS with plugins in a dark-themed UI.	Inactive (demo project – last commit in 2021) ￼ ￼

Each project above is well-documented or has an example/demo. Together they showcase open-source solutions for turn-by-turn navigation with modern map frameworks, from mobile-ready SDKs to web-based route planners.
