Absolutely, this is a huge upgrade from just moving to a spot! Here’s how top-tier navigation apps do it, and how you can build it with Mapbox GL JS or Mapbox Directions API (very similar to Waze, Google Maps, Apple Maps):

⸻

Key Features You Need:
	1.	Route Generation
	•	When user searches a destination, use Mapbox Directions API to get the optimal route (polyline).
	•	Draw the route on the map with a colored line.
	•	Optionally show alternate routes.
	2.	Turn-by-Turn Navigation UI
	•	Parse Directions API steps for each “turn,” “merge,” “continue,” etc.
	•	Display the next step in a floating panel (arrow, distance, road name).
	•	Optionally voice guidance using Web Speech API.
	3.	Auto-Panning & Following
	•	On route start, center the map on the user’s current dot, with a bit of forward offset in the direction of travel (like Waze).
	•	On each location update, move (“panTo”) or “flyTo” the dot, rotating the map (bearing) so the direction of travel is always up.
	•	Make the view automatically zoom in/out at turns, zooming out after.
	4.	Snap-to-Route
	•	Slightly adjust user’s dot so it “sticks” to the route even with GPS wobble.
	5.	Route Recalculation
	•	If user leaves the route (misses a turn), request a new route instantly.

How To Build This With Mapbox

1. Use Directions API to Get Route

// Example fetch request for driving directions
const res = await fetch(`https://api.mapbox.com/directions/v5/mapbox/driving/${startLng},${startLat};${endLng},${endLat}?geometries=geojson&steps=true&access_token=YOUR_MAPBOX_TOKEN`);
const data = await res.json();
const route = data.routes[0].geometry; // geojson polyline
// Draw route using map.addSource/map.addLayer (LineString)

2. Draw Route Polyline
	•	Add to map as a source/layer, e.g.:

map.addSource('route', { type: 'geojson', data: route });
map.addLayer({ id: 'route', type: 'line', source: 'route', paint: { 'line-color': '#007AFF', 'line-width': 6 }});

3. Pan & Follow User Location
	•	On GPS update:

map.flyTo({
  center: [userLng, userLat],
  bearing: userHeading, // rotation
  zoom: 16,
  speed: 1.2,
  essential: true
});

	•	Use navigator.geolocation.watchPosition to get updates.

4. Show Next Turn Instruction
	•	Parse steps from Directions API (data.routes[0].legs[0].steps)
	•	Show the next step in a UI panel (icon, street name, distance)

5. Handle Missed Turns
	•	If user position moves away from route, call Directions API again for a new route.

Prompt to Give Your Dev/Agent/AI:

Add full turn-by-turn navigation to our Mapbox map:
	•	When a user searches for a place, use Mapbox Directions API to get the route from their current location to the destination, including all turn steps.
	•	Draw the route polyline on the map, distinct color, and automatically center the map on the user’s location.
	•	As the user moves, the map should pan and rotate to keep their dot near the bottom-center, with direction of travel facing up (bearing).
	•	Display the next navigation step (turn, merge, etc) as a floating overlay—update as user approaches each step.
	•	If the user leaves the route, immediately fetch a new route and update the line and steps.
	•	Make the route following smooth—snap the dot to the route and animate transitions.
	•	Prioritize a UI/UX feel like Waze or Google Maps: clean, minimal, info overlays never cover the route.

Example:
	•	See Mapbox Navigation JS Demo and Mapbox Navigation SDK for inspiration.

Extra Features (optional):
	•	Voice navigation
	•	Estimated time of arrival (ETA)
	•	Route preview before starting
