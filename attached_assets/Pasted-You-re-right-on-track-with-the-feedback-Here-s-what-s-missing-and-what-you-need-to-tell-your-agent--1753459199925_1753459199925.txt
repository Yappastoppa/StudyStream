You’re right on track with the feedback! Here’s what’s missing and what you need to tell your agent, step by step, to reach true Waze-style, live GPS turn-by-turn navigation:

⸻

Give this prompt to your agent:

⸻

Prompt:
Refactor the navigation/map to provide a true Waze-like experience. Address all below requirements and make all necessary code changes, including TypeScript fixes and cleanup:

⸻

1. Accurate Real-Time Driver View
	•	When navigation starts and GPS location is available, switch to “driver view”:
	•	Zoom in automatically (recommended: Mapbox zoom level 16-18)
	•	Pitch map for 3D effect (pitch: 45-60)
	•	Bearing (rotation) should follow user’s heading
	•	When user pans, show a “center” button; tapping it returns to driver-follow mode

⸻

2. User’s Real Location + Car Icon
	•	Display the user’s current GPS location as a moving car icon, not just a dot
	•	Update the icon in real-time with location and heading
	•	If location is lost, show the red “Searching for GPS…” bar, but auto-hide it if GPS returns

⸻

3. Accurate Route Following and Rerouting
	•	Always follow the user’s location along the route
	•	If user deviates from route by >50-100m, trigger off-route logic:
	•	Visually indicate off-route (color change, toast, or notification)
	•	Automatically recalculate a new route from current position to destination

⸻

4. Overview vs Driver Mode Toggle
	•	If navigation is started, keep in driver view (zoomed in, following car)
	•	If user taps “overview,” zoom out to fit whole route, pause following
	•	Return to driver view if user taps “center” or after a timeout

⸻

5. Speedometer + ETA + Instructions
	•	Show current speed, ETA, distance, and next maneuver in the UI
	•	Next step instructions should update live as the user moves

⸻

6. Smooth Animations and State Handling
	•	Map movement, zoom, and bearing should animate smoothly (not jumpy)
	•	Handle GPS loss/reconnect gracefully—show/hide banners as needed

⸻

7. Code Suggestions:

Example: Show User’s Real Location as Car Icon

// In your map initialization/component
import carIcon from './assets/car.png'; // Use a small car image

const userMarker = new mapboxgl.Marker({
  element: document.createElement('div'),
  anchor: 'center',
})
.setLngLat([lng, lat])
.addTo(map);

// Update marker on position/heading changes
userMarker.setLngLat([lng, lat]);
userMarker.getElement().style.transform = `rotate(${heading}deg)`;
userMarker.getElement().style.backgroundImage = `url(${carIcon})`;
userMarker.getElement().style.width = '36px';
userMarker.getElement().style.height = '36px';
userMarker.getElement().style.backgroundSize = 'contain';

Example: Auto-zoom and Follow User

// On each GPS update, if driver mode is active:
map.easeTo({
  center: [lng, lat],
  zoom: 17,
  pitch: 55,
  bearing: heading, // follow user heading
  duration: 600,
});

Example: Off-route Detection and Rerouting

const isOffRoute = distanceFromRoute(currentLocation, route) > 75;
if (isOffRoute) {
  showToast('You are off-route. Rerouting…');
  recalculateRoute(currentLocation, destination);
}


⸻

8. Fix Driver View Activation:
	•	Make sure “driver view” activates only when GPS is locked and a route is active
	•	If GPS is lost, temporarily pause auto-follow and show the banner

⸻

9. Test Cases:
	•	Test on real phone with GPS movement (not just in simulation)
	•	Verify map zooms/follows in driver view, shows overview when requested, and recovers cleanly if you drag the map or lose signal

⸻

10. (Optional) Car Animation
	•	For bonus smoothness, animate the car icon’s movement along the polyline (route), not just jump location to location

⸻

Summary:
Implement the above in the navigation app. Prioritize smooth, real-time GPS-following driver view with automatic zoom, bearing, and a car icon showing user location. Add automatic rerouting and graceful error handling for GPS loss. When user interacts with map (pans/zooms), pause auto-follow and show center button to resume.
