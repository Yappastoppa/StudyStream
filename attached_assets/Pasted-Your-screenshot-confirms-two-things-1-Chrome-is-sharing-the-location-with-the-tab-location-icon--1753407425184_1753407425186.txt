Your screenshot confirms two things:
	1.	Chrome is sharing the location with the tab (location icon is solid, browser permission is granted).
	2.	Your app still says ‚ÄúLoading GPS Map‚Ä¶‚Äù and shows 0 MPH, 0.0 Miles, and the map never appears.
	3.	No activity/usage in Mapbox dashboard.

This is classic for one of these two reasons:

‚∏ª

1. GPS Is ‚ÄúAllowed‚Äù But Not Resolving

Even though Chrome shows ‚Äúlocation is allowed,‚Äù sometimes on localhost, VPNs, or cloud dev environments, the Geolocation API call never returns actual coordinates (especially if the browser can‚Äôt get your real device IP or the Replit sandbox restricts the API).
	‚Ä¢	Check the browser‚Äôs JS console (F12) for errors/warnings like:
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúGeolocation error: Timeout expired‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúOnly secure origins are allowed‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúUser denied Geolocation‚Äù (shouldn‚Äôt show if allowed)
	‚Ä¢	Or any uncaught error in the GPS/map logic

‚∏ª

2. App Code Is ‚ÄúStuck‚Äù Waiting for GPS

The frontend code probably does:

navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(successCallback, errorCallback)

If the callback never fires (browser stuck), your code will never execute the logic to initialize Mapbox.

üî• Quick Debug: FORCE Mapbox to Load

Here‚Äôs how to prove your Mapbox code is fine (and see activity on your dashboard):

1. Edit your frontend map component (e.g., Map.tsx or wherever Mapbox is initialized).

Replace the GPS usage with a hardcoded fallback:

const defaultCoords = { lat: 40.7128, lng: -74.0060 }; // NYC

// Instead of waiting for GPS:
const coords = defaultCoords;
mapboxgl.accessToken = import.meta.env.VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN;
const map = new mapboxgl.Map({
  container: 'map', // Your map div id
  style: 'mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v11',
  center: [coords.lng, coords.lat],
  zoom: 13
});

Comment out/remove all code that waits for or uses navigator.geolocation.

‚∏ª

2. Save and restart the frontend.

3. Refresh your app.
	‚Ä¢	The map should load in NYC instantly!
	‚Ä¢	You‚Äôll see usage on your Mapbox dashboard

‚∏ª

If this works:
	‚Ä¢	Your Mapbox integration and token are 100% correct.
	‚Ä¢	The only issue is the environment‚Äôs inability to resolve browser GPS.

If you want help with the code edit, just copy-paste the relevant part and I‚Äôll show you exactly what to change.

TL;DR:
Your Mapbox code is not the problem. The browser environment is not providing usable GPS coordinates, even though permission is granted.
Force the code to use a static location to prove it‚Äîand see the map load!
